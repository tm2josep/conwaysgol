<h1>Conway's Game of Life </h1>
<h2> Rules: </h2>
<h3>
<br/>
For a space that is 'populated':
<br/>
Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
<br/>
Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
<br/>
Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
<br/>
<br/>
For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated':
<br/>
Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
